# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is my first step towards learning full stack development through the University of Minnesota coding bootcamp. This project has given me a starting point to learn by teaching me how to use Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although I still have more to learn, I'm looking forward to it. This project is also very much my guinea pig.
